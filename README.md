# Go_kedex_MASTER
Personal Pokedex Webpage to make it easier to track every possible pokemon in Pokemon GO.
This is a personal project based on the RPlus pokemon shiny checklst to expand to every pokemon, evolution stage, costume, shiny, lucky, shadow, etc.
Also eventually working toward showing "% done" based on the amount of IV's away from perfect every pokemon listed is.
